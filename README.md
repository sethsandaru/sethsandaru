Welcome, my friends.

My name is **Seth Phat**, nice to meet you. I'm working as a Senior Backend Engineer @ Aspire, #1 NEOBank of SEA

Many people knows me as a super funny, friendly, optimistic and energetic guy who really loves Technology & Programming since his high school years. I'm a continuous learner, team-player.

I'm living & working in HCMC, Vietnam. I have built (and building) a lot of awesome products (including the **Vue Form Builder**, my beloved project).

Want to know a secret? My first-ever programming language I learnt was **Lua** (from 2009 - when I was in 9th grade). And then, **PHP** (2010) 😆 😂
