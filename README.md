Hello mate,

My name is **Seth Phat**, nice to meet you. Currently a Senior Rockstar Engineer and loves to level-up awesome products.

People know me as a super funny, friendly, optimistic and energetic guy who really loves Technology & Programming since his high school years. I'm a continuous learner, team-player.

I'm living & working in HCMC, Vietnam. I have built (and building) a lot of awesome products and libraries. Still continue doing so with full power.

Want to know a secret? My first-ever programming language I learnt was **Lua** (from 2009 - when I was a 9th-grade student). And then, **PHP** (2010) 😆 😂
