Hello mate,

My name is **Seth Phat**, nice to meet you. A Senior Rockstar Engineer who loves to elevate awesome products 🔥.

People know me as a super funny, friendly, optimistic, and energetic guy who has loved Technology & Programming since high school 🥰. I'm a continuous learner, team-player 🏎️.

Living in Vietnam & working with engineers around the globe 😆. Can't start my day with a lovely Ca Phe Sua Da Saigon (Milk Coffee) ☕️.

Fun facts: 
 - The first-ever programming language I learned was **Lua** (in 2009 - when I was a 9th-grade student) to develop quests/missions & NPCs in games 👀
   - And then, **PHP** (2010) 😎 
 - I do cardio almost every day (20~30 mins, after working hours). Favorites: Running & Jump Rope 🏃‍♂️
 - I love to try every kind of beer (but <=6.5% 🥹)
